# Welcome to the ARTIST Association ☀️!

We’re thrilled to have you here and hope you find what you're looking for 🙌!

The ARTIST Association develops software tools and datasets for differentiable ray tracing in solar tower power plants using digital twins. ARTIST stands for **A**I-enhanced differentiable **R**ay **T**racer for **I**rradiation Prediction in **S**olar Tower Digital **T**wins. It is an open-source `Python` package, built on the powerful machine-learning framework `PyTorch`.

Our mission is to advance solar energy technology through the application of artificial intelligence, enabling improved calibration and efficiency for heliostats in solar thermal plants.

We build and develop `ARTIST` based on the publication below:
